VPN Internship Task Report
Introduction
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tool that helps protect your online privacy and security by encrypting your internet connection and masking your IP address. This ensures that your online activities remain private and secure, especially when using untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi.

Explanation
In this task, we set up and tested a free VPN service (ProtonVPN) to understand how it works. By connecting to a VPN server, our real IP address was replaced with the serverâ€™s IP, hiding our location. The VPN also encrypted all internet traffic between our device and the server, protecting data from eavesdropping.

We verified that our IP address changed while connected and tested browsing both secure (HTTPS) and insecure (HTTP) websites. Even on non-secure websites, the VPN encrypted traffic between our device and the server, protecting our data on local networks. Disconnecting the VPN showed our original IP and faster speeds but without encryption.

This exercise demonstrated how VPNs play an essential role in enhancing privacy and security online.
